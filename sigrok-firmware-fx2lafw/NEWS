0.1.2 (2014-05-06)
------------------

 * Fix an issue which lead to the data pins not being tri-stated after an
   aquisition (when the GPIF is idle) but rather being driven.
 * Bump the firmware version (major.minor) to 1.1. This version is
   backwards-compatible and doesn't require host-side (libsigrok) changes.

0.1.1 (2013-04-16)
------------------

 * Add support for the USBee DX. Only digital sampling is supported (as is
   the case for all other supported devices so far). Analog data acquisition
   is currently not implemented.
 * Add support for devices with the older Cypress CY7C68013 (FX2) chip
   instead of the more recent Cypress CY7C68013A (FX2LP). See also:
   http://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw#Cypress_FX2_vs._FX2LP
 * Convert to a standard autotools based build/configuration system.
   Installation is now: ./configure && make && make install
 * README: Update status, website URLs, requirements, etc.
 * Add the usual HACKING, AUTHORS, and INSTALL files.
 * Add a 'distbin' Make target, which creates a convenience tarball
   containing just the generated *.fw files.
 * Document the download location for the pre-built firmware files tarball.
 * If 'objcopy' is not found, try to use sdcc's 'makebin' instead.
   This fixes the build e.g. on some Mac OS X systems without 'objcopy'.
 * Add support for differently named sdcc tools on various distros.

0.1.0 (2012-07-24)
------------------

 * Initial release.
