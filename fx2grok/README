The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

The fx2grok device is intended to be the tinyiest possible Open Hardware FX2
eval board (that can be used as 8-channel logic analyzer).

Using the open-source fx2lafw firmware (and sigrok, of course) you can use
this device as 8-channel logic analyzer.
