5050RGBSet LED strip
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of the signals on a controller for the
5050RGBSet LED strip.

The signals were grabbed on a 14-pin SOIC chip (no markings).
The red/blue/green pins on the chip control the (R/G/B) LED color, the
SDA/SCL pins are connected to an Atmel AT24C02N EEPROM, and the IR pin is
directly connected to the wires leading to the IR remote receiver.
