S/PDIF transmission 2-channel 16-bit 48kHz (bitrate: 3.072 Mbit/s)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example of an S/PDIF transmitter playing the same rectangular
waveform on both channels.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was an Open Logic Sniffer (OLS) (at 50MHz).

The 50MHz is way above the 3.072MHz so we have some margin to distinguish
"long" from "short" samples.
