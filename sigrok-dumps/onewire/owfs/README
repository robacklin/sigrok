Onewire/OWFS dumps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains 1-Wire aveforms generated with OWFS.

Details:
TODO.

Tools used:

 - Logic Analyzer: Tektronix TLA 613
 - Software: owfs 2.8p15
 - 1-Wire master: home made from
   - PL2303 (USB to UART)
   - DS2480B (UART to 1-Wire)

1-Wire MicroLan:

Two thermometers were attached to the bus (only the data line was connected,
power was not):

 - DS28EA00 (1-Wire Digital Thermometer with Sequence Detect and PIO)
 - DS18B20 (Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer)

The server was started as:

 $ owserver -d /dev/ttyUSB0


owdir.sr (samplerate = 1MHz)
----------------------------

A request to list devices connected to the bus was performed:

 $ owdir
 /28.9BCFC8000000
 /42.A8A603000000
 /bus.0
 /uncached
 /settings
 /system
 /statistics
 /structure
 /simultaneous
 /alarm


ds18b20.sr (samplerate = 1MHz)
------------------------------

A read temperature request was performed for the specified device:

 $ owread /28.9BCFC8000000/temperature
         25.5


ds28ea00.sr (samplerate = 1MHz)
-------------------------------

A read temperature request was performed for the specified device:

 $ owread /42.A8A603000000/temperature
       26.875


Conversion from TXT to sigrok dumps
-----------------------------------

The provided dumps were exported from a Flextronix TLA 613 logic analyzer
(as text files). A simple Python script was used to convert these dumps,
first into a binary file and then into a sigrok session file.
