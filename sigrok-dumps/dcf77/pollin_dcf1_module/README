DCF77
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of a DCF77 signal. The hardware used for
receiving the signal is a Pollin DCF1 module (3.3V supply). The Pollin
order number for the module is 810 054.

The dumps were made January 9, 2012 in the evening/night.
Only the dcf77_480s_pon_interrupted.sr dump was made January 10, 2012 in

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Saleae Logic (at 1MHz):

  Probe       DCF77 module
  ------------------------
  1 (black)   PON
  2 (brown)   DATA


Data
----

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=1mhz --time 1800s \
             -p '1=PON,2=DATA' -o dcf77_1800s.sr

The time and samplerate varies, depending on the file.

The dcf77_480s_interrupted.sr file contains a dump where the power was removed
from the module one or more times during the capture.

The dcf77_480s_pon_interrupted.sr file contains a dump where the PON pin was
set from low to high (PON = high means that the device is disabled) for a
few seconds, then back to low.
