ARM ETM/ITM Tracing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example capture from ARM Cortex-M3 ETM/ITM trace stream.

The trace was captured from LPC1769 microcontroller while running
this software (revision bffb804):
https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/Smoothieware/tree/bffb804

The data has been captured with the CPU running at 4 MHz at 12 MHz samplerate,
to capture all the data. It has then been cut to a smaller fragment and
samplerate set to 300MHz so that times correspond to realtime speeds.

Configuration for decoding:
- UART signal 0, baudrate 100000000
- TPIU stream 2
- ARM_ETMv3, elffile=smoothieware.elf

The ETM capture has been configured without direct branch reporting,
so the .elf file is needed for proper decoding.

Note that the source code is not visible in the GUI (and not in objdump output
either), because it is not included in this repo. You can download it from the
above github link. Due to how gcc stores debug info, you have to put it in this
path if you want it to show: /home/petteri/projects/Smoothieware.


Logic analyzer setup

The logic analyzer used was an FX2 based device (at 12MHz, but see above):
