Texas Instruments TLC5620 8-bit quad DAC (http://www.ti.com/product/tlc5620)

These captures were grabbed from a running Velleman PCSU1000 USB oscilloscope.
This device reconfigures its hardware, including the TLC5620 that controls
level triggering, after every frame transfer. This accounts for the regular
traffic in these captures.
