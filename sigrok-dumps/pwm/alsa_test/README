Hardware used
=============
* Saleae clone 
* Olimex AT Mega32U4 "T" board
  https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/AVR-T32U4/

For "high speed" operation, the T32U4 must be jumpered to run on 5V!

Software
========
* avr-gcc & companions
* ALSA
* LUFA
  http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php
  in particular, the ClassDriver/AudioOutput demo
  LUFA-140302/Demos/Device/ClassDriver/AudioOutput/

Adapted the Makefile:

14c14
< MCU          = at90usb1287
---
> MCU          = atmega32u4
16,17c16,17
< BOARD        = USBKEY
< F_CPU        = 8000000
---
> BOARD        = OLIMEXT32U4
> F_CPU        = 16000000

[make; avrdude ...]

Left channel on OC3A (pin32) -> Olimex "D5" -> probe 4.

Run "aplay -D front:CARD=Demo,DEV=0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/test.wav"
while the Saleae records for 8 seconds. The result is pwmtest.sr.
Probe 5 was unterminated, see the crosstalk.

You can test the PWM decoder via CLI and extract the raw values:
sigrok-cli -i pwmtest.sr -P pwm:pwm=4 -B pwm=raw > PWM.raw

Add e.g. some .wav header using sox:
sox -t raw -e unsigned -b 8 -r 64000 PWM.raw PWM.wav
