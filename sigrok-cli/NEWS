 * Command line option changes:
   - Add the -g|--channel-group option.
   - Add the -M option (for PD meta output type support).
   - Add the -B option (for PD binary output type support).
   - Rename the -p|--probes option to -C|--channels.

 * Bugfix in the handling of -A options with arguments.
 * Updated build dependencies list.
   - glib (required): Now must be >= 2.28.0.
   - libsigrok (required): Now must be >= 0.2.0.
   - libsigrokdecode (required): Now must be >= 0.2.0.

   - The -a|--protocol-decoders option was renamed to -P|--protocol-decoders.
   - The -s|--protocol-decoder-stack option was renamed to
     -S|--protocol-decoder-stack.
   - Added a --driver option to specify which libsigrok driver is to be used.
   - Added a --show option. This can show details about drivers or PDs.
   - Added a --frames option which limits the number of frames to get from
     a supported oscilloscope (or other frame-based device).
 * Various documentation updates (README, manpage, and so on).
 * configure: Don't overwrite CFLAGS, but rather amend it.

0.3.1 (2012-05-30)
------------------

 * Add a ChangeLog file to the tarball.

   The -s option is no longer required in this special case.
 * Only output module or PD output goes to stdout, everything else to stderr.
 * Improved error handling: Stop sigrok-cli upon various PD related errors.
 * New -A | --protocol-decoder-annotations option which allows the user to
